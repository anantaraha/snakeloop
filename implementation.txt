### Basic Implementation
- The field is a CSS grid of size 41x41   
- The snake is an array containing grid items acquired by itself   
- Every 150ms, the game elements(snake position, length etc.) are calculated & updated, resulting in a fixed framerate   
- In each frame, the grid items are colored/updated to draw the snake & food   
- Thus the snake speed depends on the framerate   
- The food is placed randomly, ensuring that the new food position is not on the snake itself   
- Navigation keypresses are buffered to make the snake responsive
